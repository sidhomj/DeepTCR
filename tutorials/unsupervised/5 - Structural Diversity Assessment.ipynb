    "DeepTCR can be used to assess the structural diversity within a repertoire. One can think of this structural diversity assessment as being a measure of the number of antigens or concepts within a repertoire. A repertoire that has low diversity is recognizing few antigens while one with a high diversity can recognize more. We will assess two measures of diversity. The first one is the number of clusters/concepts of TCR sequences are present in each sample/repertoire. And the second is how entropic is the distribution of the sequence reads across these clusters. For example, a sample can have 12 clusters but if 90% of the repertoire is is one cluster, this would be a low entropic repertoire."
