Generally, you will have data that is organized by TCR sequences (either alpha or beta or paired alpha/beta) with v/d/j gene usage and counts/frequencies for those sequences. We will go over two methods by which one can load data into DeepTCR."

    "The first way is to load data that is stored in TCRSeq delimited filed (like those produced by Adaptive Biotechnologies). First, it's important to put your data into a main directory with sub-directories if the data is organized in a way with natural labels (i.e. antigen specificity or treatment cohorts). The main directory reflects the project of data while the subdirectories represent possible groupings/class labels of your data. An example of this formatting can be seen in the Data directory provided. Several datasets exist and can be looked for their formatting. If there is no labels for the data, set the directory to the folder where the data is stored and the files will be loaded with no label. The program can either take csv or tsv files (comma,tab delimited files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has been prepared in the directories as directed, one can call the following command to load the data.The important inputs into this function include the directory where the data is stored, whether we want to aggregate to only unique aa (aggregatate_by_aa=True), and then the columns where our data is stored. For example, the beta chain data is located in column 0. DeepTCR can take any type of TCRSeq data as long as at least one type of data is provided.Of note, if this command has been executed previously, one can choose to se the Load_Prev_Data parameter to True to directly load the saved data quickly from an automatically stored pickle file."
